            "content":"In Los Angeles, the shortage of affordable housing contributes to the rising costs of rent, increasing rates of homelessness, and displacement of low-income residents. The housing shortage disproportionately affects minorities and low-income families living in communities like East and South Los Angeles. In general, the families that spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing are considered cost burdened (HUD). This affects minorities and low-income families because they often have difficulty affording necessities such as food, clothing, transportation and medical care (HUD). In order to afford rent, family members have to take on extra jobs to make ends meet.<br><br>&nbsp&nbspThe LIHTC program was created to provide low-income families with affordable housing, so the qualifying developers agreed to rent units to low-income people for a specified amount. Prior to 1990, the developers were required to maintain affordable units for at least 15 years. However, after 1990 developers with LIHTC allocations have an additional 15-year restricted-use period, for a total of 30 years. After the affordability restrictions end, LIHTC property owners may convert the affordable housing units to market rate. The following Map would show the actual Affordable housing Projects which would expire in the 2020-2025."
